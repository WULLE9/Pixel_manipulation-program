The pixel_manipulation program works by encrpting function, it shifts the RGB values by a user-specified shift_value. it then saves the encrypted image.
The Decryption also works by reversing the shift applied to the pixel values, restoring the original image.
The main function is to grant the user to encrypt or decrypt the image file path, and input a shift value
